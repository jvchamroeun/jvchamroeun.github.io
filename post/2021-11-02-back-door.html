                        <h2 class="section-heading">Objective</h2>
                        <p>A backdoor is perceived as a vulnerability because it allows an attacker to obtain access to the victim&#39s machine without any proper credentials. While the program can be considered a security flaw, it can establish as a tool for debugging and analytical activities by a developer.</p>
                        <p>In this project a backdoor program will be initiated where the attacker is capable of executing shell commands on the victim&#39s machine and return a corresponding response back to the attacker.</p>
                        
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Constraint</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The backdoor must camouflage itself so as to deceive anyone looking at the process table.</li>
                            <li>The backdoor must ensure that it only receives (authenticate) those packets that are meant for the backdoor itself.</li>
                            <li>The backdoor must interpret commands sent to it and execute them and send the results back.</li>
                            <li>Incorporate and encryption scheme into the backdoor.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Approach</h2>
                        <p>The client program will be able to connect with another device and be able to execute Linux commands against the victim&#39s machine. Messages will be encrypted using AES encryption scheme while sending data to the server. </p>
                        <p>When the victim machine sends the message back to the client, it will also be encrypted with the AES encryption scheme. Once the message is received at the client it will be decrypted into plaintext.</p>
                        <p><strong>Encryption and Decryption:</strong> Encrypts client&#39s Linx commands using AES from the Pycryptodome library. The master key is user provided and stored as a global in the script.Undoing the encryption will require decrypting using the correct AES master key and IV.</p>
                        <p>The primary programs for this application are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>client.py - Responsible for sending commands to the backdoor, and listening for result return from backdoor.</li>
                            <li>server.py -  Responsible for running packet sniffing. Establishes TCP connection back to the remote client, and sends results back to the remote client.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The packets will be crafted using the scapy library. Once the command is inputted on the attacker machine, it will be encrypted and and stored as a payload for the TCP header. The communication will be done using the IP/TCP headers. To indicate that to the backdoor that the packets are specfically from the attacker, the packets will be have a ttl of 71.</p>

                        <p><strong>Test 1: Process Masking</strong></p>
                        <p>This test was to check that the backdoor program on the victims machine is able to successfully mask it&#39s process name. In this case, changing the process name from server.py to <strong>[kworker/2:8505]</strong> as set in the command line arguments.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/21-back-door/d4.png" alt="..." />
                        <p>Figure 3 shows a list of kworker processes in which the backdoor will blend in with.</p>

                        <img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/21-back-door/d5.png" alt="..." />
                        <p>The backdoor script server.py is masked to <strong>[kworker/2:8505]</strong>, shown in Figure 4, and is successfully hidden amongst the kworker processes.</p>

                        <p><strong>Test 2: Communication with Ports</strong></p>
                        <p>This test was to check whether packets sent from the attacker to the victim were being sent to and from the correct ports. Specifically, from source port 500 to destination port 80.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/21-back-door/d6.png" alt="..." />
                        <p>The packets from the attacker, shown in figure 5, are being correctly sent from the source port (500) to the destination port (80) on the victim machine.</p>

                        <p><strong>Test 3: Attacker Commands Encrypted</strong></p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/21-back-door/d7.png" alt="..." />
                        <p>Figure 6 shows the initial command arguments to set up the program, and the program initializing and prompting for a command. The command ”ls” is sent from the attacker and is then waiting for a response.</p>

                        <img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/21-back-door/d8.png" alt="..." />
                        <p>Figure 7 verifies that the packet containing the command ”ls” is not in plaintext and is encrypted using the AES encryption scheme which is accomplished with the encryption key and IV in the command arguments in Figure 6.</p>

                        <p><strong>Test 4: Backdoor Commands Encrypted</strong></p>
                        <p>This test checks to see whether the command is being executed on the victims system and whether results are being sent back.</p>

                        <img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/21-back-door/d9.png" alt="..." />
                        <p>Figure 8 shows the initial command arguments to set up the program, and the program initializing and listening for incoming packets. The command ”ls” is received from the attacker and is then executed on the victim machine. For the purpose of testing, the output of the command is displayed in the terminal and the results are sent back to the attacker.</p>

                        <img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/21-back-door/d10.png" alt="..." />
                        <p>Figure 9 verifies that the packet containing the results is not in plaintext and is encrypted using the AES encryption scheme which is accomplished with the encryption key and IV in the command arguments in Figure 8. The encryption key and IV must be the same on the backdoor and attacker side to decrypt the packets.</p>

                        <p><strong>Test 5: Results Received</strong></p>
                        <p>This test verifies whether the correct results are being received on the attacker&#39s machine.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/21-back-door/d11.png" alt="..." />
                        <p>Figure 10 verifies that the command ”ls” and ”ifconfig” were sent to the victim machine and the correct response was received. The attacker receives file names and the IP address of the victim&#39s system.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusionn</h2>
                        <p>This implementation is only compatible with Linux-based systems. The application itself could be further developed to include features that allow backdooring other operating systems. The following application has room to develop certain features like Armitage and Meterpeter where it could use exploitation techniques such as screenshots, file transfer, data sniffer and other malicious activities.</p>
